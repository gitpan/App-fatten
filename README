VERSION

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides command-line utility called fatten.

  TODO
FUNCTIONS
  fatten(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   debug_keep_tempdir => *bool* (default: 0)

        Keep temporary directory for debugging.

    *   exclude => *array*

        Modules to exclude.

        When you don't want to include a module, specify it here.

    *   exclude_core => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to exclude core modules.

    *   exclude_pattern => *array*

        Regex patterns of modules to exclude.

        When you don't want to include a pattern of modules, specify it
        here.

    *   include => *array*

        Include extra modules.

        When the tracing process fails to include a required module, you can
        add it here.

    *   include_dist => *array*

        Include extra modules.

        Just like the "include" option, but will include module as well as
        other modules from the same distribution. Module name must be the
        main module of the distribution. Will determine other modules from
        the ".packlist" file.

    *   input_file* => *str*

        Path to input file (script to be packed).

    *   output_file => *str*

        Path to output file, defaults to `packed` in current directory.

    *   perl_version => *str*

        Perl version to target, defaults to current running version.

    *   strip => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether to strip included modules using Perl::Stripper.

    *   trace_method => *str* (default: "fatpacker")

        Which method to use to trace dependencies.

        The default is "fatpacker", which is the same as what "fatpack
        trace" does. There are other methods available, please see
        "App::tracepm" for more details.

    *   use => *array*

        Additional modules to "use".

        Will be passed to the tracer. Will currently only affect the
        "fatpacker" and "require" methods (because those methods actually
        run your script).

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.
